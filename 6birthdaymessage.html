      Hello, Mikki. This is your boyfriend speaking. YOU'RE 19! HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! And this marks another milestone in your life. I'm glad you made it this far. And I'm glad you did it while I'm still in your life. You are, by far, the best thing that has ever happened in my life. To say that you changed my life is an understatement. You are literally the light of my life and the reason why I wake up every morning. I wouldn't wish for another girlfriend even if a genie offered me a thousand.
      <br>
      <br>
      I hope you are always happy and in good health. And always take the opportunities to have fun and excitement in life. Keep on being you and keep on being a great person to be with. I hope you live very long and achieve all of the dreams you wanna achieve. Especially the dreams we have made together. I know they will happen. We just need to wait and just keep on loving each other, which I know will never stop happening.
      <br>
      <br>
      That's all I have to say. I wish you a very <big>HAPPY 19<sup>th</sup> BIRTHDAY</big> and more birthdays to come. I LOVE YOU!
    </p>
