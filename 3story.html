<p class="lazerjunkies">

Lucie stood alone as she watched the stoplight turn from green to red. Beyond the roads, a dormant volcano triumphed. There, on that place, her eyes were awakened once by someone special. Once in a rare while, that volcano would cease its slumber and cry lava as pink as an e-girl’s lipstick. It was where this city got its name, Pinkcry. 
<br><br>
She limped across the road while carrying her backpack. The crystals rattled inside like windchimes. She still had it, but not for long. She had to keep moving; otherwise, all the sacrifices were for nothing. She kept walking until the sound of an order-up bell, the clanging of plates and cups, and the electrifying noise of the neon signs that said Vulcan’s Diner caught her attention. She stood in front of the diner’s window. A reflection of a teenage girl with a broken bloody nose, cut lips, and hanging eyebags looked back at her. Although as messed up the girl appeared outside, it was no match for what was inside. Looking up from the diner, she saw her final destination, Mt. Dream. This is it. This is all what it’s leading up to. Dropping this backpack like a kamikaze would finally end all of this bullshit. This bullshit that started with me, she thought. 
<br><br>
The bell in the doorway rang as she opened it. “No. 1 Party Anthem” by Arctic Monkeys was playing. She felt a sudden, piercing sting in her heart. Inside, the people gave her curious stares. Of course, who would ignore looking at a girl who was an advertisement for bandages?  She sat at the side of the diner where she could see the volcano through the window. She put her pink Sayonara Kitty-themed backpack beside her and hugged it with one arm. As if she were hugging her. A pretty waitress came and asked for her order. She had large eyebags that showed how overworked she probably was. Lucie froze at the question. She kept staring at this waitress with a slight smile on her lips. She had never seen her before here. 
<br><br>
“Miss, what can I get for you? If you can’t choose, our special for today is the cranberry pie,” the poor waitress repeated.
<br><br>
“Could I get a blueberry pie instead, please?" Lucie insisted.
<br><br>
“We don’t seem to have one today, I’m sorry. I guarantee the cranberry pie is just as good.”
<br><br>
“No,” Lucie argued. “I’d like a blueberry pie. I know you have a cold one stored at the back. I’ll happily take that. No need to heat it up.”
<br><br>
“Alright,” said the waitress, raising an eyebrow. “I’ll go check first. Anything else? A drink? We have some good coffee.”
<br><br>
“I’ll have one, thank you. A question, please?" The waitress nodded in approval. “Is the volcano open today for someone to climb?”
<br><br>
“I’m not sure. It’s not entirely prohibited, but I wouldn’t suggest it,” the waitress answered while pouring coffee into her cup. “Those science people say Dream is somewhat mildly active these past weeks. Notice the smoke? ”
<br><br>
“Good, then,” said Lucie.
<br><br>
“I know better than to ask a girl with bruises and bandages her reasons, but...” the waitress paused for a bit. “You’re not one of those people who plans to have an explosive finale, right?”
<br><br>
“No, not my finale. But something else, though,” said Lucie as she drank the coffee, feeling the hot, sweet beverage tingle in her wounded lip.
<br><br>
“Well, good luck, I guess,” said the waitress, smiling but with curved eyebrows. “I’ll be back with your blueberry pie.”
<br><br>
Lucie took another sip of the coffee as she watched the volcano through the window. Her eyes felt heavy, but it feels like they're floating at the same time. She tried to stop the flashes of images from coming back in her head, but she’s not strong enough to control it and the feelings. 
<br><br>
“I miss you,” she breathlessly whispered to herself.
<br><br>
After a few minutes, the waitress came back holding a plate of pie. Lucie smelled it and couldn’t help but smile for a bit, even though she still felt somber. 
<br><br>
“You were right, girl. How did you know?” The waitress asked her. 
<br><br>
“Someone here told me before,” Lucie smirked a little. 
<br><br>
The waitress chuckled. “Enjoy your pie.” Lucie thanked her.
<br><br>
As Lucie put her hand over the fork to get it, she noticed it shaking. At the corner of her eye, she felt a red light flickering. She gasped and took cover. Red light blasted through the window, shattering the glasses into a thousand shards. Lucie was thrown over the floor, shards covering her. She tried to get up until she noticed him walk towards her. His gas mask covered his whole face while a black and red suit covered his body. She quickly looked to find her bag. It was thrown far away. Not enough time to get it. 
<br><br>
The masked man was now standing above her. Even behind those covers, Lucie could see behind it. His eyes. The weary veins and decaying skin. His pain permeated through that mask and even stinged Lucie herself. He slowly raised his arm and shaped his fingers to form a gun. Like a child would. The tip starts to glow red. 
Lucie closed her eyes and accepted her fate. “Do it.” She opened them up and saw the beautiful scarlet reflection on the glass that covered his dead eyes. The red light got brighter until it's blinding.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
					6 Months Earlier
          <br><br>
Lucie didn’t go to class today. Again. Lying on the bed, she had her hand between her legs but she had already finished. She stared at the ceiling, her phone in her chest, while her mind kept popping the question: if she had gone to school today, would her mood be any better? She threw away that thought as she threw away her phone at the end of her bed. When she stood up, she realized she probably needed to erase her search history, just in case pesky Claire borrows her phone again with no permission. Someone knocks at the door. He opens it before Lucie could even allow him in. He always does that. It’s annoying. 
<br><br>
“Oh, good, you’re awake,” Daymond came in while buttoning the cuffs of his formal shirt. It’s green, his favorite shade. To him, it makes him look like a sophisticated professor. But he only looks like a dork.  His nose wrinkled. “It reeks of leaves in here. How much did you smoke today? Open the window from time to time, will you?”
<br><br>
Lucie rolled her eyes as she sat back down at her bed. “What do you want?” 
<br><br>
“Did you forget already?” He tucked his hands into his grey slacks. “It’s my big day. The school’s going to give me my award for my project I submitted for the inter-school contest. Everyone’s going to be there, and I expect you to be there too. You didn’t attend your classes today, so you might as well go and get your daily dose of the school environment you so desperately need.”
<br><br>
“Why do you even need me there?” Lucie argued. “Can’t I just congratulate you right now and give you a big siblingly hug even though I find that gross? ” 
<br><br>
His brother walked closer and sat on her bed. “Because mom and dad expect you to be there. And I want you to feel proud of me too. It’s a big achievement in my life. I don’t want you wasting your day and life smoking at home. It would be nice when I come on stage; I can look down on you and–”
<br><br>
“Look down on me?” She interrupted and stood up.
<br><br>
“Hey, you know I didn’t mean it like that.”
<br><br>
“Then what else could you mean? You want to come there so you could wipe that award in my face and show off how much of a smart genius you are.”
<br><br>
“You said ‘smart’ and ‘genius.’ That’s redundant.”
<br><br>
“See?” She raised her in annoyance. “This is what I mean. You find every opportunity to make me feel dumb. Because that’s how you see me!” 
<br><br>
Mom walked in. “You two! For god’s sake, stop it. Don’t ruin this night.” 
<br><br>
Lucie looked away, trying not to make eye contact with either of them or even see their presence. She stared at a sketch on a piece of paper posted on her wall. A funny doodle of a banana that she and Claire drew. 
<br><br>
“Harold! Can you get my earrings downstairs in the bathroom?” Mom turned to her. “And you, young girl, will go to the ceremony tonight. No buts, no reasons, no excuses. If you want to keep quiet, that’s perfectly fine. But you will go there and see the good thing your brother has done. End of story.” Lucie heard her footsteps as she walked away.
<br><br>
She felt a hand on her shoulder and heard her brother’s voice. “I’m sorry, Lucie. Ignore what mom said. I want you to be there because you're my sister and I love you. It’s a special moment for me that I want to share with the people I cherish the most. That includes you, the prettiest sister in the world.”
<br><br>
Lucie turned around and looked at his brother’s smile. He was being genuine; she could feel it. Once in a while, he was true to her. She put her arms around her and buried her face in her shoulder. 
<br><br>
“Okay,” her voice muffled. “I’ll be there.”
<br><br>
Daymond smiled. “Thanks. But take a shower first. You smell like Snoop Dogg’s unwashed bedsheet.”
<br><br>
Lucie chuckled. 
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Fuck. It’s the only word that came into her mind as she looked at her closet. She scanned at every piece of clothing, and there was absolutely none that fit the criteria of the word ‘formal.’ Her closet was filled with clothes that were the complete opposite. It was all crop tops, oversized tees, hoodies, sweatshirts, mini-skirts, denims, ripped jeans, and an old worn-out ice cream parlor uniform. 
<br><br>
“The fuck am I going to wear?" She sat down on her bed and put her fist on her cheek. She stayed in that position for a while. 
<br><br>
Then neurons fired in her head. Under where she was sitting. She kneeled down and turned on the flashlight on her phone. It was filled with dust, cobwebs, old rags and shirts, and probably rat droppings. Damn, she thought to herself, How long since I’ve cleaned this? The box was there. She pulled it out, and dust wrapped around her hand. It’s been years since she hid this. Would it still fit her? She took the lid off, and there it was. The light from her flashlight she forgot to turn off reflected on the tiny rhinestones attached to it. Her blue dress from prom. She smiled as she lifted it out of the box. 
<br><br>
<br><br>
She stood in the mirror and held the dress in front of her. The dress did not disagree with her pigtailed hair dyed in pastel pink. They look pretty together. She smiled. “Sometimes, I forget how pretty I can still be even when I dress like a stuck-up.”
<br><br>
Her phone rings. She picked it up, and it was Claire’s goofy picture. She swiped it right to answer. 
<br><br>
“Girl!” Claire’s voice is too loud even when Lucie hasn’t put the phone in her ear yet. “Are you awake? There’s a fun party at Artie’s hangout near Mt. Dream goin’ on right now, and you have to come here. Artie brought his cousins from the other town, and they are so freaking hot. You have to check them out, especially the short one. Don’t let height discrimination get to you because he’s the cutest out of all them. He’s so Levi. Hello?”
<br><br>
“Yeah, I’m here, Claire,” Lucie answered. “But I don’t know if I can come.”
<br><br>
“Really?” Claire said in a skeptical tone. “Because you always come. You come even if you’re sick, have a test, or even when you need to go to a funeral. Remember that one time you snuck out of the hospital after you got hit by a car because you wanted to get baked with me and my cousin?”
<br><br>
Lucie chuckled at that memory. “I know, Claire, but I got a really important thing today, and I don’t want to disappoint my brother. It’s his big day today.”
<br><br>
She could hear her sigh. “Alright fine. Next time, I guess.”
<br><br>
“Go have fun for me, okay? Send me some pictures later too.”
<br><br>
Claire chuckled. “You bet I will. I’ll send a whole fucking album with just this cute guy’s pictures. Oh wait, this bitch is getting on my nerves; she’s been all over him for a while. Gotta go, bye-bye!” 
<br><br>
The call ended, and Lucie threw her phone back at the bed. She turned to the mirror and held the dress again in front of her. 
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Lucie chose to sit at the back, against the wishes of her brother. The whole environment of this auditorium makes her mind feel uneasy. Seats are filled with people whom Lucie knew would make a condescending comment at first sight of her. She kept her head low and watched her brother in the front seat. She hasn’t seen him smile this much. But she sensed something in his eyes. Could there be something wrong? She ignored that thought. This is a happy day for him. 
<br><br>
A fat, balding man in a brown suit went up the stage and stated opening remarks for the event. His speech included the usual generic motivational bullshit that Lucie tuned out of her ears. Minutes passed, and she heard his name called. She was the first to clap for him. Lucie could feel the edge of her lips come closer to her ears. The fat man handed him a certificate in those fancy awards sleeves. Written on it was “Excellence in Chemistry Awarded to Daymond Philip J. Glass,” and under was the science project that her brother did for the school that Lucie couldn’t understand what it was about. Daymond shook hands with the fat man and the other teachers, then walked up to the mic to give his speech. 
<br><br>
“First of all, I’d like to say thank you to my teachers who never failed to support me in my endeavors, especially to Mr. Narvaez.” He points to him. “Second, to my family, my mom and my dad, who always wanted this for me. Now I got it for ya, mom and dad.” He holds up the award. “It’s here. You always say that every good thing comes with hard work, and hard work will always be rewarded. These…” He turned the award to face him, and he looked down upon it. "These are the things that matter in life. It’s what gives it meaning. What is life worth if not the achievements you gained along the way? A man who has tried and tried and failed would always be better than a man who never tried at all. I’d rather fail than waste my life doing nothing.”
<br><br>
Lucie felt a weird feeling in her chest. It was as though his heart was collapsing on itself. Cannot breathe. She turned her eye back to his brother. Their eyes met, and he made a short pause in his speech. His face started to become blurry. Lucie scratched her nails in her thighs. Lucie stood up and walked outside the auditorium. No one noticed but him. She slowly walked away in the hallway, but she could still faintly hear his voice as he continued his speech. “Can I say I’m finally proud of myself? Well…” She couldn’t hear him anymore. 
<br><br>
<br><br>
Outdoors was so cold. She had been sitting on this bench beneath the streetlight for 5 minutes, and she’s only noticing now. An empty void filled her. She was not angry, nor did she want to cry. But it does hurt. She doesn’t exactly know why. But it does. She took out her phone and saw Claire’s dozens of messages. She scrolled through all of them and saw photos of people drinking, smoking, and kissing. Claire seemed to be having too much fun. 
<br><br>
It’s time. Her body and mind seemingly whispered to her. She can’t take this. She has to get out of this feeling. And there’s only one way out. She went to her contacts and called her. “Hey, Claire. Is the party still on?”
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Laughs, shouts, moans, and other weird noises grew louder as she walked towards them. She passed by a guy and a girl making out on top of the table. Bottles and cups falling off. On the opposite side, three guys are making out with each other. 
<br><br>
Then she stumbled upon them. They’re formed in a large circle of about thirteen people, passing drinks and bongs. A girl turned around and squeaked. Claire was wearing her usual white croptop and checkered mini-skirt. She wore it so often like a cartoon character who only had one set of clothes in their wardrobe. Holding a beer bottle, she ran towards Lucie with both arms open to hug her.  
<br><br>
"I knew you'd come, girl! You never let a chance like this go." Claire holds her and drags her towards the group. "Let me introduce you to all of them. Well, at least the important ones." She leans in to whisper. "And when I say important ones, I meant the ones who are either attractive, rich, or weird in an interesting way." 
<br><br>
Lucie looked at the people as Claire dragged her closer to them. All of them were gazing upon her as if examining if she fit their personal social criteria. She seemed to pass the first impression test because she didn't feel like anyone was judging her. 
<br><br>
“Everyone,” Claire announced. “This is Lucie, my best friend, and she went here to have some fun because apparently her family is being a bitch to her.”
<br><br>
“Nah, I just really wanted to get high from free dope.” The guys chuckled. 
<br><br>
“You look beautiful in that dress!” A girl in a bomber jacket said. “Was it prom night tonight?”
<br><br>
“Nah, I just got from an event from school.”
<br><br>
“Oh, that’s Suzanne,” Claire pointed to the girl that complimented Lucie. “And that’s Artie, you know him, and this is Jaydee, and the cute guy over there is Albert.” Claire giggled as she pointed to the guy wearing a beige knit vest over his collared long-sleeve shirt. He nodded at her, and his beautiful curtain-parted hair flowed. 
<br><br>
They went back to talking with each other. Claire kicked a guy off his seat. He was sort of creepy-looking anyway. She gestured for Lucie to sit on it right next to her. A guy next to her offered her his bong. She lit the bong and inhaled the steam. It felt good. Her head feels lighter now. The thoughts are slowly sailing away from her head. She thanked him, and the guy smiled and winked. 
<br><br>
Albert continued his rant. “So anyway, this class president guy had the nerve to shout at us in front of the classroom and scold us like kids. I mean, yeah, we did cut class, but he doesn’t have the right to shout like that to us. What is he, the fucking owner of the school? What does he give a fuck if we cut class? It doesn’t give him higher grades at all or add inches to his dick. Not that he has any. Wanna know what I think? I think he’s just jealous that we got to have fun, meanwhile he’s trapped in the teacher’s office assisting them or licking their wrinkly pussy or whatever.” 
<br><br>
“Nah, man,” a tall guy across him interjects, “I think it’s ‘cuz they get a kick out of it, y’know. They got uh–” he tapped the girl next to him. “What do they call it? Superman compass? Yeah, Superman Compass, they think they’re better than you ‘cuz they’re smart. They think they can boss ya around.”
<br><br>
Another guy with a bowl cut threw a piece of peanut at him. “It’s superiority complex, you fucking dumbass.”
<br><br>
“Ow!” The compass guy groaned. “Whatever, you fucking nerd. You get my point.”
<br><br>
Albert inhaled his bong. “Whatever it is, man. They got no fucking right. Who says all ya need in life are schools and books? I got street smart. That’s all I need.”
<br><br>
“Street smart?” Suzanne said, rolling her eyes. “You’re a fucking pampered spoiled brat who lives off daddy’s allowance.” Everyone roared with laughter. Lucie covered her mouth with her hand and silently laughed. 
<br><br>
“So what? I still grew up in the streets. My dad never raised me.” Some girl said boo-hoo. “So I went to the streets to experience the hard life.” He knocked on his chest with his fist. “And I gotta say, it’s tough. It ain’t easy.”
<br><br>
Lucie couldn’t hold the laughter this time. They’re all idiots, she thinks to herself. But she knows she’s just as pathetic as them. Albert noticed her laugh and looked at her.
<br><br>
“Hey, Cinderella,” he called her. “What’s your story?”
<br><br>
“Do I have to give one?” Lucie asked. “Is this like an ‘introduce yourself’ segment like in class?”
<br><br>
Claire answered it for him. “Nah, it’s so they get to know you more. For conversation’s sake. They certainly learned a lot about me. Oh, maybe too much.” She chuckled.
<br><br>
“What’s there to know about me?” She thought to herself the answer to that question too. “I don’t know. I guess lately I’ve been feeling unsatisfied with something, and I don’t even know what. I don’t know where I’m heading. No one… ah fuck it.” She takes a hit from the bong as she tries to hold back the tears. “This life. My life. I don’t know what to do with it.”
<br><br>
This whole time she kept her eyes low, but when she looked up, no one was looking at her except Claire and that cute guy Albert. 
<br><br>
“Damn,” the compass guy remarked. “That’s philonthropical as fuck.”
<br><br>
“Philosophical,” the bowl-cut guy corrected. 
<br><br>
“Hey, in the end, who gives a shit?” Albert said. “It’s your life. You only live once. So who cares? Just have fun with it. That’s all that matters. Do you wanna be one of those people that jump on that volcano over there? That’s what happens when people think too much. All’s I’m saying.”
<br><br>
Lucie rolled her eyes and just took another hit. Her head felt lighter again. Time passed, and the conversation topics switched from one to the other. Lucie didn’t bother to listen. In the end, they were all high. Lucie was lying on the grass with her hands pillowing the back of her head. Her lips were smiling, but her eyes were lazily staring at the night sky. Albert’s voice was prominent once more. He was bragging about something to the ones left sober. 
<br><br>
“I promise you, you’ve seen nothing like it,” he bragged. “This is not a normal high. It can literally make you feel like a god.”
<br><br>
“Oh, really?” Suzanne doubted. “The way you talk about it, it’s like this thing’s out of a sci-fi movie.”
<br><br>
“It might as fucking well be,” he replied. “When I took a hit. My eyes glowed brighter than the fucking sun. And then the lights came out of my eyes and burned my wall. That’s why my dad is still mad at me. I did it outdoors ever since.”
<br><br>
“You mean like a laser coming out of your eyes?” Bowl-cut guy asked.
<br><br>
“Yes, like a fucking laser,” he answered. 
<br><br>
“Oh, oh, oh,” said the bowl-cut guy. “I’ve heard about this. In Brunoland, at night, there would be fucking light shows and chaos. And in the morning, everyone would find ashes and burn marks all over. So it’s true?”
<br><br>
“Yes, it’s true,” said Albert. “And guess what? I happen to have one of them.”
<br><br>
Everyone who seemed asleep got up. 
<br><br>
“You’re kidding?” Said the tall, dumb guy.
<br><br>
Albert stood up and walked to his car. He opened the trunk to pull a metal box. He returned with a large grin on his face. “Do I look like I’m kidding?” He put a key in and opened it.
<br><br>
Lucie was far away, but he could see the light making his face glow. It was blue. He put his hands slowly in the box, and as he raised it back, a glowing blue crystal the size of a strawberry was in his palm. 
<br><br>
“Who wants to try it with me?” He offered. But for the first time, everyone was in silence. 
“I’ve heard some people die using that,” Suzanne commented after a long pause.
<br><br>
“That’s true,” he admitted. “But when’s the next time you’re going to be able to try one of these for free?” He chipped a tiny shard off the crystal. “One gram of this costs twenty grand. You smoke this and you’re going to be high for days.” He holds up the small, whole crystal. "But if you smoke this whole thing, your eye will glow so bright, you’ll make the sun jealous.”
<br><br>
Everyone remained in silence as they just stared at the crystal. 
<br><br>
“I know y’all are scared. There’s illegal.” He held up a bag of marijuana. “And there’s this type of illegal.” He held the crystal closer to them. 
<br><br>
Lucie looked at Claire and saw her looking away. 
<br><br>
“So does anyone wanna try with me or are you all a bunch of pussies?” No one answered. He looked at Lucie and nodded. “How about you? Do you wanna run away with me? I promise to hold your hand all the way.” 
<br><br>
Does she dare try? She had tried a lot. Coke, poth, a little bit of meth, but not this. Not this extreme. Lucie found her whole body getting up and slowly walking towards him. Her eyes were glued to the crystal as she went. 
<br><br>
“Hey, girl,” called Claire. “I don’t think it’s safe.”
<br><br>
“It’s alright, Claire,” said Albert. “It will be fun.” Lucie stood in front of him.
<br><br>
“Are you ready?” He asked in a low tone; his voice was so raspy. It made Lucie look up at him. She saw the blue light reflecting in his dreamy eyes. 
<br><br>
“I don’t know,” she whispered. 
<br><br>
“Do you wanna go to a place you’ve never been before?” Albert asked. “One where no one can tell you what to do except the voice in your head that tells you what feels good to do?”
<br><br>
Lucie stared at his eyes. “I’m scared.”
<br><br>
“Me too,” Albert smirked. “Everytime I use it, I’m terrified. But that’s what makes it feel good. Because it’s dangerous.”
<br><br>
Lucie looked down and saw his hand crush the whole crystal in his palm. As his palm opened, glowing blue smoke released. He poured it onto the table and shaped it into a line with a card. 
<br><br>
“You know what to do,” said Albert. Lucie put her nose down and moved her head to snort the line. Albert snorted his own line too. The tiny shards prickled her nose and her insides. But there was no initial kick. She felt nothing for a while. She looked back at Claire, who had a concerned look on her face. 
<br><br>
Her whole body frozen. Pupils dilated. Heart skipped a beat. Brain flowed outwards, then collapsed on itself. Her mouth quickly swallowed cold air. Her temples got hotter and hotter. Now, its her eyes. Itchy and hot. She scratched it and looked back at Albert. He was grinning, and his eyes were glowing yellow. He held up a mirror in front of her. There it was. Her eyes are glowing blue. 
<br><br>
“My eyes are burning!” She screamed at Albert and groaned in pain. 
<br><br>
"Hey, make it fucking stop!” Claire called out. “It’s hurting her!”
<br><br>
“That’s because you haven’t done what feels good yet.” Albert stood behind and held her head. He turned her face towards an empty space in the field. “Let it out.”
<br><br>
“Let what out?” She screamed back.
<br><br>
“The light,” he raspily whispered in her ear.
<br><br>
“I can’t do it!” She argued.
<br><br>
“Yes, you can. Whatever it is that you’ve been holding back. Just let. It. Out!”
<br><br>
Lucie felt her whole energy focus on her eyes. All her blood was rushing up and pooling in her head. She remembered what her brother said. What her mom said. What everyone had said about her. Fuck ‘em, she thought to herself. She felt her eyes glow bigger. Her vision is being filled by only blue. It’s starting to feel good. Every bad feeling she had was being replaced by what’s good. Fuck school, she thought again. Another surge of euphoria went into her body. Fuck my parents. 
<br><br>
“There you go, you got it,” said Albert. “Just a little more and…”
<br><br>
“Fuck Daymond,” she whispered.
<br><br>
Lucie was blinded in blue. Her eyes released blue light out of her eyes. Her whole body recoiled back. Everyone ran away from her. As all the light escaped out of her eyes, her whole body felt good, as if she were floating. The light stopped after a long while. She saw her reflection in the mirror that fell on the floor. Blue veins in her eye appeared, and her face was in eternal bliss. She turned back to Albert, who had a large, proud smile on his face. 
<br><br>
Lucie returned a smile as a tiny, single steaming tear flowed from her eye and said, “I want more.”
